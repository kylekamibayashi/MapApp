            "description" : "San Francisco has a 1% Art Program that requires all projects involving new building, or the addition of 25,000 square feet or more in the Downtown and nearby neighborhoods, provide public art equal to at least 1% of the total construction cost. This program was established by the 1985 Downtown Plan and is governed by Section 429 of the Planning Code. Since May 2012, some projects may choose to dedicate a portion of their 1% Art requirement to the City's Public Art Trust.
